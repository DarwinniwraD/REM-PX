## Instructions

### Converting px to rem
1. Select a px value (e.g. '16px')
2. Hit ctrl+shift+r by default (cmd+shift+r on Mac OS) to convert the value to rem. (Can also be done by selecting 'Convert highlighted px to rem' under the tools menu)

## Supported Features
- Convert px values to rem
- Convert rem values to px
- Checks to make sure the value is a valid px unit to convert to rem and visa versa

 "{
    "1rem": 12
 }" 
at Preferences/Package Settings/REM-PX/SettingsUser menu.
2. All values will remove trailing zero's (e.g. '1.500rem' would become '1.5rem').
